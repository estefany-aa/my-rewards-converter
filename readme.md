# :airplane: Credit Rewards Converter :airplane:
This is the project repository for the JPMC Software Engineering Lite Program. This two-task program simulates the process of completing an engineering ticket in the credit-card rewards department. The implemented two tasks are as follows: 
1. Created a RewardValue class that allowed the RewardsConverter system to accept a cash value and return a corresponding value in airline miles.
2. Wrote a test suite for the class added in the previous task.
